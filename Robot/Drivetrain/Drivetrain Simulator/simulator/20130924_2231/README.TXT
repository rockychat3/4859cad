build 20130924_2231

Added voltage drops to the model.

Added Vm (voltage at the motors) to the output for graphing.

High motor currents cause voltage drops across the battery's internal resistance,
the main breaker, the 40A breakers, the wires, and the connections.

The voltage drops reduce the voltage available at the motors and affect their performance.

Change the gear ratio G from 12.75 (Toughbox am-0145) to 4.67 (CIMple Box am-0734) and see the
huge difference in performance and current draw.
